<p class="steps"><strong>Step 1:</strong>Trim beef of excess fat and sinews (aka the chewy stuff), pat the meat dry with a paper towel and chop into 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces.
</p>
<p class="steps"><strong>Step 2:</strong>Preheat your dutch oven (or your large soup pot with a heavy bottom), to high heat. Once it’s hot, stir in your 1/3 cup canola oil. Once oil is hot, add chopped meat and saute uncovered 7 min over high heat until meat is browned, stirring every minute or so so it doesn’t scorch to the bottom of the pan.
</p>
<p class="steps"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Reduce heat to medium and Add chopped onion, stirring often until onion is softened (5 minutes). Stir in sliced carrots, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 3-4 bay leaves and continue to cook over medium heat 5 minutes until carrots are softened.
</p>
<p class="steps"><strong>Step 4:</strong>Add 1 3/4 cups hot water, cover & simmer over medium/low heat 45 min or until meat is tender.
